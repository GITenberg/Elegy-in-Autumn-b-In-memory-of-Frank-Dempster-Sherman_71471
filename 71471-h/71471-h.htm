</div>

<h2>I</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Brother in song, you who have gone before</div>
<div class="indent2">Along far incommunicable ways,</div>
<div class="verse">Leaving me here upon this mortal shore,</div>
<div class="indent2">A bondman to the tyrant nights and days,</div>
<div class="indent5">Across the distance, hail!</div>
<div class="verse">Though Time may sever, and we meet no more,</div>
<div class="indent5">Yet what shall Time avail!</div>
</div></div>

<h2>II</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">’Twas Autumn when we first set hand to hand,</div>
<div class="indent2">And eye to eye, in loyal comradeship;</div>
<div class="verse">Drowsed with a draught of Beauty seemed the land,</div>
<div class="indent2">As it had raised a golden cup to lip;</div>
<div class="indent5">But you embodied Spring,</div>
<div class="verse">Its harvest hopes, its deeds in joyance planned,</div>
<div class="indent5">Its brave adventuring.</div>
</div></div>

<h2>III</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">I can recall your buoyance,—can recall</div>
<div class="indent2">The star-sown hours beneath the Cambridge trees,</div>
<div class="verse">When o’er us wheeled the bright processional</div>
<div class="indent2">Of bold Orion and the Pleiades,</div>
<div class="indent5">And how we strolled along</div>
<div class="verse">Laughterful, and oblivious to all</div>
<div class="indent5">Save the sweet thrall of Song.</div>
</div></div>

<h2>IV</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Youth has its visions and its fervors; yours</div>
<div class="indent2">Were lovingly enlinked with Poesy;</div>
<div class="verse">You dreamed the dream that many an one allures,</div>
<div class="indent2">The vernal dream where life is harmony.</div>
<div class="indent5">And though the years estranged</div>
<div class="verse">Your full allegiance, something still assures</div>
<div class="indent5">My heart you never changed.</div>
</div></div>

<h2>V</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">What merriment was ours those shut-in nights</div>
<div class="indent2">When Winter, clamorous at the casement, cried!</div>
<div class="verse">What dear association, what delights</div>
<div class="indent2">As we in friendly emulation vied,</div>
<div class="indent5">While Aspiration’s cruse</div>
<div class="verse">Was brimmed for us, beholding on dim heights</div>
<div class="indent5">The presence of the Muse!</div>
</div></div>

<h2>VI</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">And then there opened wider paths to tread</div>
<div class="indent2">When Love, with Song, beguiled you on and on,</div>
<div class="verse">While Art around your feet unfaltering shed</div>
<div class="indent2">Its luminous light, irradiant as the dawn;</div>
<div class="indent5">Though you saw many part</div>
<div class="verse">From deities long worshipped, you were wed</div>
<div class="indent5">Inalienably to Art.</div>
</div></div>

<h2>VII</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">What though the rigid chains of circumstance</div>
<div class="indent2">Oft held you in the trammels of the town,</div>
<div class="verse">Your heart went woodward where the fairies dance</div>
<div class="indent2">What time the moon its silvery sheen sifts down.</div>
<div class="indent5">You loved the reeds and rills,</div>
<div class="verse">The sea, the shore, their glamour and romance,</div>
<div class="indent5">And all the climbing hills.</div>
</div></div>

<h2>VIII</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">And when you made escape, and sensed the wild</div>
<div class="indent2">Aromas beat about you, when you fared</div>
<div class="verse">By tracks unwonted, like an unleashed child</div>
<div class="indent2">You gleefully your gay abandon shared.</div>
<div class="indent5">Care from your shoulders thrown,</div>
<div class="verse">You seemed an Ariel spirit, long exiled,</div>
<div class="indent5">Come back unto its own.</div>
</div></div>

<h2>IX</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">With gracious Memory again I go</div>
<div class="indent2">To tread with you where meads are green and gold,</div>
<div class="verse">Where upland slopes are strewn with daisy-snow,</div>
<div class="indent2">And bee-balm torches light the flocks to fold,</div>
<div class="indent5">And willow branches wave</div>
<div class="verse">Above Oriskany, singing far below</div>
<div class="indent5">Its liquid summer stave.</div>
</div></div>

<h2>X</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Now south we sail where stormy currents meet</div>
<div class="indent2">Round the wind-harassed cape of Hatteras,</div>
<div class="verse">Beyond whose beacons, when the tides retreat,</div>
<div class="indent2">The wide sea-mirror is like burnished glass;</div>
<div class="indent5">There, ’mid the drowsy calms,</div>
<div class="verse">As Ponce de Leon did of yore, we greet</div>
<div class="indent5">The tall Floridian palms.</div>
</div></div>

<h2>XI</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Here down the live-oak aisles ’tis ours to stray</div>
<div class="indent2">With wraiths of many a stern conquistador,</div>
<div class="verse">Those vanished warriors of an elder day</div>
<div class="indent2">When gray San Marco bore the brunt of war;</div>
<div class="indent5">Here we in revery lean</div>
<div class="verse">Upon the ramparts beetling o’er the bay,</div>
<div class="indent5">And watch the shifting scene;—</div>
</div></div>

<h2>XII</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The boats that dip and dart like living things,</div>
<div class="indent2">Seeking the open sea beyond the bar;</div>
<div class="verse">The graceful gulls with sunlight on their wings</div>
<div class="indent2">Up the Matanzas soaring fleet and far</div>
<div class="indent5">Where inlets deep beguile;</div>
<div class="verse">And o’er the waters undulant shimmerings</div>
<div class="indent5">The low coquina isle.</div>
</div></div>

<h2>XIII</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Then, at the drooping of the twilight hour,</div>
<div class="indent2">We wander in the ancient plaza where</div>
<div class="verse">We breathe the attar of the jasmine flower</div>
<div class="indent2">Like incense on the altar of the air;</div>
<div class="indent5">And list, as music swells</div>
<div class="verse">Down drifting from the old cathedral tower,</div>
<div class="indent5">The arpeggio of the bells.</div>
</div></div>

<h2>XIV</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">We linger by the sea-wall while the tide</div>
<div class="indent2">Below us murmurs like a sad refrain,</div>
<div class="verse">Bearing from outer ocean reaches wide</div>
<div class="indent2">The lore and legend of the Spanish main,</div>
<div class="indent5">Nor leave that spot serene</div>
<div class="verse">Till Sleep, as with the mantle of the bride,</div>
<div class="indent5">Wraps fair Saint Augustine.</div>
</div></div>

<h2>XV</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Days dedicate to rapturous things were these;</div>
<div class="indent2">It was as though Youth came again, and brought</div>
<div class="verse">Past aims, past ardors and past ecstasies,</div>
<div class="indent2">And toward the shrine of Beauty turned our thought.</div>
<div class="indent5">And there were after times</div>
<div class="verse">Of exultation, prismic harmonies,</div>
<div class="indent5">When hours ran by in rhymes.</div>
</div></div>

<h2>XVI</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Once, ’mid cathedral Carolinian pines,</div>
<div class="indent2">We saw the Springtide, at its radiant birth,</div>
<div class="verse">Kindle to fragrant gold the coiling vines,</div>
<div class="indent2">And make a garden of the wakened earth;</div>
<div class="indent5">And every morning heard</div>
<div class="verse">Within the treetops, melody linked with mirth,</div>
<div class="indent5">The hidden mocking-bird.</div>
</div></div>

<h2>XVII</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">And while the cardinal through the waving bredes</div>
<div class="indent2">Of pendulous moss swift flitted like a flame,</div>
<div class="verse">Back flooded to our minds the illustrious deeds,</div>
<div class="indent2">Emblazoned on the honor-scroll of Fame,</div>
<div class="indent5">When Liberty was won,</div>
<div class="verse">Hearkening the Ashley whisper to its reeds</div>
<div class="indent5">The name of Marion.</div>
</div></div>

<h2>XVIII</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">From Gloucester cliffs and brown Nantucket dunes</div>
<div class="indent2">The mountains lured you, and the mountain star;</div>
<div class="verse">For us the Woodland sang its lyric runes</div>
<div class="indent2">Where’er we followed it, or near or far,</div>
<div class="indent5">In sun or shadow cool,</div>
<div class="verse">Or loitered through long languorous afternoons</div>
<div class="indent5">By Dian’s darkling pool.</div>
</div></div>

<h2>XIX</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Far up the valley Wittenberg’s vast form,</div>
<div class="indent2">Its summit beckoning, with you I view,</div>
<div class="verse">And above sweeping slopes where wild bees swarm</div>
<div class="indent2">Glimpse timid deer at dawn and fall of dew;</div>
<div class="indent5">Through Panther Kill we roam,</div>
<div class="verse">And mark the purple streamers of the storm</div>
<div class="indent5">Ascend behind the Dome.</div>
</div></div>

<h2>XX</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">And, too, in bookmen’s mines of dusty ore</div>
<div class="indent2">Ever shall I remember how we delved,</div>
<div class="verse">Plucking from out the musty treasure-store</div>
<div class="indent2">Rich rarities within the darkness shelved,</div>
<div class="indent5">Elated if we found</div>
<div class="verse">Leaves that some name we long had honored bore</div>
<div class="indent5">In frayed morocco bound.</div>
</div></div>

<h2>XXI</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Thus, step by step, we trod adown the years,</div>
<div class="indent2">Thus, side by side, with ne’er a break between;</div>
<div class="verse">We shared our laughter and we shared our tears,</div>
<div class="indent2">Nor deemed inexorable Fate might intervene</div>
<div class="indent5">To sever the strong cord</div>
<div class="verse">That bound us, Fate with its “abhorrèd shears,”</div>
<div class="indent5">That is man’s over-lord.</div>
</div></div>

<h2>XXII</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">You that in Autumn came, in Autumn went;</div>
<div class="indent2">How vain to say the mourning word! how vain</div>
<div class="verse">To beat the bars of that arbitrament</div>
<div class="indent2">That metes to mortals pleasurement or pain!</div>
<div class="indent5">How vain!—how vain!—and yet</div>
<div class="verse">We beat upon them, and we only gain</div>
<div class="indent5">The poignance of regret!</div>
</div></div>

<h2>XXIII</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Autumn again with all its loveliness;</div>
<div class="indent2">Autumn again that brought an end to joy,</div>
<div class="verse">Despite the sight of earth in amber dress,</div>
<div class="indent2">And airs that bear the blitheness of a boy!</div>
<div class="indent5">Autumn, and leaves that toss</div>
<div class="verse">In bright brief triumphing, while they express</div>
<div class="indent5">The brooding sense of loss.</div>
</div></div>

<h2>XXIV</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Autumn again down every winding way</div>
<div class="indent2">That, in the days gone by, our footsteps pressed!—</div>
<div class="verse">Instead of woven amaranth would I lay</div>
<div class="indent2">Above your dust—you gone by paths unguessed—</div>
<div class="indent5">Love’s deathless asphodel;</div>
<div class="verse">Until some happier hour,—when, who shall say?—</div>
<div class="indent5">Brother in song, farewell!</div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div>
<div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>
<div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div>
<div class='secthead'>

<div class='secthead'>
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>
<div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>
<div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>
<div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>
<div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>
<div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

<div class='secthead'>
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div>
<div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>
<div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
<div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>
<div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
